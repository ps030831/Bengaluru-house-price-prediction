# Bengaluru-house-price-prediction
This project predicts house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning models based on features like location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and bathrooms. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, converting non-standard formats, and engineering new features like bhk and price_per_sqft. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps identify trends and remove outliers. Regression models such as Linear Regression, KNeighbors Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor are implemented, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance. Evaluation metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to compare model accuracy.

The project integrates a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions, allowing users to input details like location, size, and number of rooms to get an estimated price. Key technologies include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The models are trained and validated on the cleaned dataset, and visualizations highlight model performance and accuracy. This tool provides actionable insights for understanding housing prices in Bengaluru.
